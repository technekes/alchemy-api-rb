# AlchemyAPI

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/technekes/alchemy-api-rb.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/technekes/alchemy-api-rb)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/badge.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/technekes/alchemy-api-rb)

This is a Ruby Client Library that provides access to the [Alchemy text mining API](http://www.alchemyapi.com/). The current version targets the following API's:

* Keyword Extraction
* Text Extraction
* Entity Extraction
* Relation Extraction
* Sentiment Analysis
* Concept Tagging
* Text Categorization
* Language Detection
* Author Extraction
* Image Tagging

Not yet implemented API's:

* Content Scraping
* Microformats
* RSS / ATOM

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'alchemy-api-rb', :require => 'alchemy_api'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install alchemy-api-rb

## Usage

You'll need to [request an API Key](http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/register.html).

Set your API Key in an initializer or something similar:

    AlchemyAPI.key = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

You may set the key along with other config settings:

    AlchemyAPI.configure do |config|
      config.apikey = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
      config.output_mode = :xml # not yet supported
    end

Request keyword extraction for a string of text:

    results = AlchemyAPI.search(:keyword_extraction, :text => "hello world")

or

    results = AlchemyAPI::KeywordExtraction.new.search(:url => "http://www.alchemyapi.com/")

or

    results = AlchemyAPI::KeywordExtraction.new.search(:html => "<html><body>lorem ipsum</body></html>")

Results for keyword extraction are returned as a array of keywords:

    [
      {
             "text" => "lorem ipsum",
        "relevance" => "0.993164"
      }
    ]

## Testing

The spec_helper is looking for your API Key in the project root in a file named `.keys`. Put just your key in there and then you can run:

    rake test

## TODO

1. Add missing Alchmey API search modes
2. Add the ability to search all supported API's in a single request?
3. Add support for raw output (JSON, XML and RDF)?
